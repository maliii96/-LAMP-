Configure Security Groups
Make sure your security groups allow traffic on ports 22 and 80. 
These ports are essential for SSH access and web server communication. Adjust your security group rules accordingly.

Move Your Private Key
To use your key pair for SSH access, move your key.pem file out of the "Downloads" folder and into the .ssh directory. 
This step is crucial to prevent any security warnings. You may encounter a message stating that the "private key shouldn't be accessible by others.
command ex: mv ~/Downloads/yourkey.pem ~/.ssh

Secure Your Key Pair
For added security, create your key pair and change its permissions to read-only.
command ex: sudo chmod 0400 ~/.ssh/yourkey.pem
This ensures that the key has read-only access, providing an additional layer of protection.

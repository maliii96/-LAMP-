After creating you instance in AWS you want to make sure you have your security groups to allow ports 22
and port 80.

Make sure to move your key.pem out of the downloads file and into the .ssh folder file in order to actually use the key pair.
If not you will get a message saying the "private key shouldn't be accessible by others". Meaning you need to move it to your secret folder.
Command:( ~mv ~/Downloads/yourkey.pem ~/.ssh)

Make sure to create your keypair and change the permissions to read only (sudo chmod 0400 yourkey.pem)
